## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository contains code and data for our project investigating asthma rates and low birth weights in relation to PM 2.5, wildfire rates and socioeconomic status in California.There is a Metadata folder containing information on each of the datasets.The Code folder contains all of the coding files relating to exploratory analysis, data wrangling and data visualizations. The Data Folder contains Raw data and Processed data files. Raw data was downloaded from the respective online databases and processed within R, subsequently stored in the Processed folder. 

Our analysis consists of running multiple linear regression models, heatmaps and scatterplots to determine which variables significantly impact low birth weights at term (tLBW) and asthma rates. We are looking at 36 counties across California for which we have complete data for the years 2005-2019.
