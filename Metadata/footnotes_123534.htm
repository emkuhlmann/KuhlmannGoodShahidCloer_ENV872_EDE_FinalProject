				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p>These measures provide estimates for population count and for important population characteristics. They can be used to identify populations or geographies likely to be at-risk for acute and chronic illnesses, exposed to different chemicals in the environment, or impacted by a public health emergency. They can be used for calculating the amount of resources needed for a public health response or for public safety. Further, they can be used to understand potential spatial or temporal trends in health effect data and to adjust for known risk factors when evaluating associations between adverse health effects and environmental hazards.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>These measures were generated using four data products:</p><ol><li>Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE)</li><li>American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates</li><li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients by state and county</li><li>Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries by state and county</li></ol><p>Measures 10-13 were derived using the following data and calculations:</p><p>Measure 10: Divide the number of households with income below the federal poverty level from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 5-year estimates by total number of households in that geography, then multiply by 100.</p><p>Measure 11: Count of households with income below the federal poverty level from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 5-year estimates.</p><p>Measure 12: Divide the population with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level from the geography&rsquo;s total population, then multiply by 100.</p><p>Measure 13: Count of population with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 5-year estimates.</p></p>

				<p><p>For SAIPE data, differences between direct survey estimates obtained from different sources (Census 2000, CPS ASEC, ACS) reflect both differences in the true levels of income and poverty (when comparing estimates for different places or different years), as well as differences in the methods by which the survey data were collected and the estimates were made.  More cautions and guidance about comparing estimates can be found on the U.S. Census SAIPE site at <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/technical-documentation/methodology.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/technical-documentation/methodology.html</a>. </p><p>The American Community Survey (ACS) data is used in estimating characteristic distributions. It is also important to keep in mind that all ACS data are estimates. Data are collected from a sample of the population in the United States and Puerto Rico rather than from the whole population. To help interpret the reliability of the estimates, the Census Bureau publishes a margin of error (MOE) for every ACS estimate. Regarding the U.S. Census ACS data for household poverty data, available data are at least 1 year behind and are estimates with varying margins of error, and the data and information are provided with the understanding that they are not guaranteed to be usable, timely, accurate, or complete. Guidance for Data Users of ACS can be found: <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html</a>. </p><p>Manmade geographic boundaries and their names are not static. Substantial changes to county or county equivalent entities that affect these data during a particular decade may be found on the Census website at <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-changes.html</a>.
